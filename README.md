## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend

```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The purpose of this system is to facilitate the process of pet adoption. It serves as a platform that gets together people that are interested in becoming pet owners as well as several adoption centers. By asking questions about their lifestyle, the app can determine which pets that are up for adoption can be suitable for them and thus increase the chances of successful adoptions. Because it gathers several adoption centers in one place, it also makes the process of adoption more accessible, and users are no longer required to browse through websites of several organizations and make different profiles or applications for each. 

### Pages

  A new potential adopter registers on this page to create an account. He/she fills in necessary profile information such as
